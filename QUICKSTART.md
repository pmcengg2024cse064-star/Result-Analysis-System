## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### ❌ "Module not found" Error
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### ❌ Excel file won't upload
- Ensure file is `.xlsx` format (not `.xls` or `.csv`)
- Check columns: `Student_Name`, `Roll_No`, and subject columns
- Verify all marks are numbers 0-100
- No missing values in marks columns

### ❌ Application won't start
```bash
# Check Python version (must be 3.7+)
python --version

# Verify Streamlit is installed
pip show streamlit

# Try reinstalling all packages
pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
```

### ❌ Charts not showing
- Go to "Analysis & Statistics" page first
- Charts generate automatically on first visit
- Wait for generation to complete
- Check `outputs/charts/` folder

### ❌ PDF generation fails
- Ensure all charts exist (visit Analysis page first)
- Check write permissions for `outputs/reports/` folder
- Try regenerating the PDF
